# Phase 2 Session Summary

## 🎉 What We Accomplished

We've built the complete **order routing infrastructure** for hedge mode! The `position_side` attribute now flows through the entire order pipeline.

### ✅ Order Pipeline Complete

```
Broker → API → Exchange Driver → Order Model
   ↓       ↓          ↓              ↓
 (TODO)  ✅         ✅             ✅
         +side      +side         position_side
```

### Files Modified

```
jesse/models/Order.py              | +2 lines (position_side field)
jesse/exchanges/exchange.py        | +6 lines (interface updated)
jesse/exchanges/sandbox/Sandbox.py | +9 lines (all methods updated)
jesse/services/api.py              | +9 lines (all methods updated)
```

**Total:** 26 lines modified across 4 core files

### What Works Now

1. **Order Model** - Has `position_side` attribute (nullable, backwards compatible)
2. **Exchange Interface** - All order methods accept `position_side`
3. **Sandbox Driver** - Passes `position_side` to orders
4. **API Layer** - Routes `position_side` through to exchange

### Test Created

```
tests/test_order_attribute_only.py - ✅ Passing
```

Validates that Order.position_side is properly defined as a CharField.

## 🎯 What's Left (Next Session)

### 1. Broker Layer (Critical)
**File:** `jesse/services/broker.py`

Add `side` parameter to order methods:
```python
def buy_at(self, qty: float, price: float, side: str = None):
    # In hedge mode, side specifies 'long' or 'short'
    return self.api.limit_order(..., position_side=side)
```

### 2. Position Execution Logic (Critical)
**File:** `jesse/models/Position.py`

Update `_on_executed_order()` to route orders to correct position in hedge mode:
```python
def _on_executed_order(self, order: Order) -> None:
    if order.position_side:
        # Hedge mode: route to specific position
        if order.position_side == 'long':
            # Update long_position
        elif order.position_side == 'short':
            # Update short_position
    else:
        # One-way mode: existing logic
```

### 3. Integration Test
Create end-to-end test that:
- Sets up hedge mode
- Submits orders with position_side
- Verifies orders route to correct positions
- Validates PNL calculations

## 📊 Progress

**Phase 1:** ✅ Core infrastructure (Config, Position, PositionPair, State)  
**Phase 2:** 🔄 60% complete  
- ✅ Order model  
- ✅ Exchange layer  
- ✅ API layer  
- ⏳ Broker layer  
- ⏳ Position execution  
- ⏳ Integration test  

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Next Session)

```bash
# 1. Continue from where we left off
cd /Users/mrnewton/Documents/GitHub/jesseHedge

# 2. Check current state
git status

# 3. Run existing tests
python tests/test_order_attribute_only.py
python tests/test_config_position_mode.py
python tests/test_position_side.py
python tests/test_position_pair.py
python tests/test_state_positions_hedge.py

# 4. Continue with Broker layer
```

---

## 💡 Key Insight

The infrastructure is **backwards compatible** by design:
- `position_side=None` → one-way mode (existing behavior)
- `position_side='long'` or `'short'` → hedge mode (new feature)

All changes are **additive** - no breaking changes to existing code!

---

## 📝 Example Usage (When Complete)

```python
# In hedge mode strategy
class MyHedgeStrategy(Strategy):
    def go_long_hedge(self):
        # Buy to open long position
        self.buy = qty, price, 'long'  # position_side='long'
    
    def go_short_hedge(self):
        # Sell to open short position
        self.sell = qty, price, 'short'  # position_side='short'
```

The `position_side` will flow through:
```
Strategy → Broker → API → Sandbox → Order
   'long'    'long'   'long'  'long'   position_side='long'
```
